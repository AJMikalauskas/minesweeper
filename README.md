Basic Mine Sweeper Game, A Fun Little Project to Test my Skills in both Angular and React

In order to run this project, start by downloading the zip from this GitHub repository. Once downloaded, unzip the folder and 
navigate to the vite-project folder which should look like this(minesweeper-react > minesweeper-react > vite-project)

Once in that folder, open you code editor which for me is Visual Studio Code and open the "vite-project" folder from there. 
For me, I normally open the Command Prompt and navigate to the folder I'm trying to run and I'll run the command "code ." and it will open in 
Visual Studio Code.

Once in the vite-project folder, navigate to the terminal which in VS Code is "Ctrl + J", and run commands "npm install" and "npm run dev".

The project should then start with a button that says "Create Board" and a gray outlined board.
